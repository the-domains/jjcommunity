# What is \#JJ?

We are the largest global photo community on Instagram. Our \#JJ COMMUNITY is comprised of the most active group of photographers, creatives, Instagram influencers, hobbyists and storytellers in the world. With over 43 million images submitted to more than 400 events per year, we have found that documenting and sharing the story of our lives through a creative, collaborative process allows people to develop deep and powerful friendships. Through daily themes, contests and events, we "create to connect" every day.

# **HOW?**

Simply tag your best Instagram images using our daily themed hashtag. You can use shots you have already posted previously, however, we really love to see our daily themes inspire you to find and create new photographs. See today's theme here: [instagram.com/joshjohnson][0].

# **WHEN?**

Every morning around 8:00 a.m. (EST), we post a new daily theme and corresponding hashtag. The[@jj\_editors][1],[@joshjohnson][2], and[@kevinkuster][3]review all of the submitted images and repost their favorite submissions throughout the day. If your image is selected to be highlighted on the main \#jj Community feed, over half a million people will see your work!

# **1,2,3******

We are all about keeping things simple, but in the spirit of our motto, "create to connect", we ask that you follow our only rule. We call it the 1-2-3 rule. For every 1 image you tag, comment on 2 and like 3\. This simple rule makes our community a fun place to gather, grow and share.

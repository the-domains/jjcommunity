title: "iit's @kevinkuster posting our theme today. Theme: Body Parts Tag: #JJ_forum_1385. Pretty simple theme today, however, when you focus on unique individual items of the human anatomy, the results can be spectacular. This great shot was submitted by @ichrisbox_in_swe and found by @jj_editor_juliablease. Start submitting your images and please don't forget our 1,2,3 rule. For everyone image you post like two and comment on three. This simple rule makes our community a great place to gather, share and grow. Keep scrolling #JJ community. @kevinkuster"

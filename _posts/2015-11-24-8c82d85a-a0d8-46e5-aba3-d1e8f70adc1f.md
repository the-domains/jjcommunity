title: "THE NEW YORK TIMES\_It used to be that the process of taking quality photos required an elaborate set-up, complete with a darkroom to reveal the results. Now the process is much simpler: put phone in hand and take photo. On February 6, the Columbus Art Museum (CMA) opened an exhibition composed of photos submitted only via Instagram, calling it “the largest mobile photography exhibition ever organized by a museum.” It’s appropriately dubbed #MobilePhotoNow. The museum partnered with #jj, an online community that operates via Instagram. Community participants from around the world submit photos they’ve taken on their cellphones based on set daily themes, like “light” or “rhythm,” and the jj leaders—founder Josh Johnson and CEO Kevin Kuster—and editors sift through and repost their favorites on an Instagram\_account with more than 620,000 followers.

Participants “connect through creativity,” meet one another’s families through their Instagram feeds and encourage each other to continue taking photos. “When these people meet in person,” he adds, “what was once a virtual relationship” quickly transforms and translates into a real-life connection, as they “feel like know each other already.” Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week When Kuster saw a comment from the Columbus Art Museum (CMA) on one of his posts, he took a look at the museum’s Instagram feed and website. “This is a museum that gets it,” he recalls thinking, one that not only realizes mobile photography is exploding, but also understands there is a community component that goes beyond the images. So he got in touch and made a suggestion. “Let’s do the largest curated mobile photography exhibition in a museum, let’s do the largest one in the world,” he remembers saying. And “they loved it.” For #MobilePhotoNow, #jj and CMA ran a different theme every week for four weeks: portraiture, street, community, and black and white. They received nearly 45,000 submissions from participants in 89 countries on six continents. Kuster and Johnson did an initial review to narrow down the pool to roughly 650 photos. CMA’s contemporary curator, Tyler Cann, and an independent photo curator, Lisa Kurzner, made the final picks. The exhibition—which includes 320 photos—has sections for each of the four themes and includes both printed and projected images.\_"

# THE NEW YORK TIMES **It used to be that the process of taking quality photos required an elaborate set-up, complete with a darkroom to reveal the results. Now the process is much simpler: put phone in hand and take photo. On February 6, the Columbus Art Museum (CMA) opened an exhibition composed of photos submitted only via Instagram, calling it "the largest mobile photography exhibition ever organized by a museum." It's appropriately dubbed \#MobilePhotoNow. The museum partnered with \#jj, an online community that operates via Instagram. Community participants from around the world submit photos they've taken on their cellphones based on set daily themes, like "light" or "rhythm," and the jj leaders---founder Josh Johnson and CEO Kevin Kuster---and editors sift through and repost their favorites on an Instagram account with more than 620,000 followers.

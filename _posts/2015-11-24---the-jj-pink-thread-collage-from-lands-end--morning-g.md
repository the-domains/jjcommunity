title: ". . THE #JJ PINK THREAD COLLAGE FROM LANDS' END. . Morning guys. It's @joshjohnson. Kevin and I are tickled pink to show off the latest #JJ collage project. ;-) Around 800 of your pinkiest pictures made the cut. I picked shots from last month's, @LandsEnd sponsored, #PinkThread forum, tagged #jj_forum_1348. . Thank you again to Land's End for supporting our community and our \"Create To Connect\" vision. From September to October 31, 2015, Lands' End donated 75% of the fee for every Pink Thread monogram and embroidery application to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation® (BCRF), with a minimum total donation from Lands' End to BCRF of $50,000. . You can comb a high res version of the collage by clicking the link in our bio. Tap on the collage to expand it and see if any of your shots made the cut. Or go to http://tagitjj.com/pink-thread-collage/. (PS. I'm noticing that the website is kind of slow right now. Undoubtably because everyone is looking at once. :-). If it's too slow come back in a bit and I'm sure it will be better) If you find your shot speak up in the comments so we can congratulate you and please let @landsend know if you're grateful they funded it. It's a pretty cool piece to be a part of. :-). . Thanks again to @LandsEnd for including our #JJ community for this fantastic cause. ."

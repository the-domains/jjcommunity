Pan Like a Pro

One of the more slick ways you can introduce a sense of speed and motion into your shots is by panning with your subject.  Here are three tips that will help you pan with the best of them. :-).

1\.  USE AN APP TO SLOW YOUR SHUTTER -- If you're using your phone I recommend shooting with an app called Manual on iOS.  I'm sure the Android folks can refer us to some Android apps in the comments.  For fast moving and closer subjects you can probably use shutter speeds around a 60th of a second. If your subject is distant or slower you may need to pan with a shutter speed of a 30th of a second or less.

The slower your shutter speed the more blur you'll capture in the background. Be carful though, it can be pretty hard to keep your subject sharp at especially slow shutter speeds.

2\.  TRACK YOUR SUBJECT -- The whole goal when panning for motion blur is to stabilize your subject in the screen.  To do this you will need to anticipate the movement of whatever you're  shooting, following it smoothly as it passes in front of you.  As you pivot from the waist, focus on keeping the subject in the same spot in the frame through the whole motion.

3\.  THEN DO IT AGAIN. . . AND AGAIN. . . AND AGAIN -- This is one tip you'll need to practice. And even when you've got it down, you're gonna find you miss a lot of shots. Don't worry, it's not you, it's just part of the game. :-).

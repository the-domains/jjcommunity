            <title><![CDATA[. . THE #JJ PINK THREAD COLLAGE FROM LANDS' END. . Morning guys. It's @joshjohnson. Kevin and I are tickled pink to show off the latest #JJ collage project. ;-) Around 800 of your pinkiest pictures made the cut. I picked shots from last month's, @LandsEnd sponsored, #PinkThread forum, tagged #jj_forum_1348. . Thank you again to Land's End for supporting our community and our "Create To Connect" vision. From September to October 31, 2015, Lands' End donated 75% of the fee for every Pink Thread monogram and embroidery application to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation® (BCRF), with a minimum total donation from Lands' End to BCRF of $50,000. . You can comb a high res version of the collage by clicking the link in our bio. Tap on the collage to expand it and see if any of your shots made the cut. Or go to http://tagitjj.com/pink-thread-collage/. (PS. I'm noticing that the website is kind of slow right now. Undoubtably because everyone is looking at once. :-). If it's too slow come back in a bit and I'm sure it will be better) If you find your shot speak up in the comments so we can congratulate you and please let @landsend know if you're grateful they funded it. It's a pretty cool piece to be a part of. :-). . Thanks again to @LandsEnd for including our #JJ community for this fantastic cause. .]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[It's @kevinkuster posting. Just wanted to take a moment and say thank you to everyone that left me a kind note, sent a text, emailed, tweeted me or said a prayer for my father and my family. I sincerely appreciated the support. I am sorry my response didn't come sooner, however, it's been a hectic three days and I just wasn't sure how to respond to the support. All the details aren't necessary and they aren't really mine to tell, however, my father is 87 and time takes a toll on the body. He was released from the hospital over the weekend and home now. Although some scary future choices will need to be made soon, we remain very positive. After thinking "how do I best thank everyone for their support" I thought it might be best for me to ask each of you a favor. Today, please take a moment and say THANK YOU to someone that has meant a lot to you in your life. Not a quick, somewhat meaningless thank you, but a really sincere thank you! Tell them how much they mean to you to. Thank them from something specific that they did. Tell them how much you appreciate them. Say the words "I love you." I promise you that your words will bless them and you will be so glad you took the time out of your busy day to really connect with someone that is important to you. Life is short and the older you get time has even more value and relationships mean even more. Today, use your time really wisely and give thanks to those that make your life better because of their presence. This is a photo of my dad during his senior year in Highschool that I have always loved. Wouldn't it be great to time travel and hang out with your parents when they were younger? Again, my sincere thanks. @kevinkuster.]]></title>

Think of an Instagramer who's work inspires you. Then, in the comments below, suggest a theme based on what you love about their account. For example I might say "A 'Family Life' theme, in honor of one of my personal favorites, @mindytingson." Get it? :-). . I'll go answer some emails, then I'll come back and pick one of your suggestions for today's theme. :-). .]]></title>
